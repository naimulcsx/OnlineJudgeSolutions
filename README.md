# OnlineJudgeSolutions
This is a repository containing  my solutions for various online judges, including: Codeforces, UVa, SPOJ, DevSkill, URI and so on.

## Language used
The solutions are written in C or C++, although most of these are written in C++. URI solutions are mostly written in C (C99 Standard).
Just try the problems on your own first. If you are stuck then, then see the solutions.
